# sierpinski
My first non-academic side project, created using the PyGame module for Python. Constructive criticism appreciated!

The idea for this project stems from the [Sierpinski Triangle Chaos Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle#Chaos_game).
To play, click on anywhere on the board to draw a point. Afterwards, the program will draw a large number of points such that they approximate the Sierpinski Triangle.
To reset the board, simply click anywhere on the screen.
DISCLAIMER: You may need to install pygame, using the command `pip install pygame` on the command line.
